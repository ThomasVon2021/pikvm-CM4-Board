If your gstreamer is version 1.8 or above, you can try the following test command. In addition, alsasrc device=hw:1 represents the sound card of TC358743, you can use \u201carecord -l\u201d to query. #The command to recode a video with audio. (GStreamer 1.18.4) gst-launch-1.0 -vvv v4l2src ! \"video/x-raw,framerate=30/1,format=UYVY\" ! v4l2h264enc extra-controls=\"controls,h264_profile=4,h264_level=13,video_bitrate=256000;\" ! \"video/x-h264,profile=high, level=(string)4.2\" ! h264parse ! queue ! matroskamux name=mux ! filesink location=foo.mkv alsasrc device=hw:1 ! audio/x-raw,rate=48000,channels=2 ! audioconvert ! avenc_aac bitrate=48000 ! aacparse ! queue ! mux. #The sample command to recode a video without audio.

PS: We recommend that you modify the above framerate parameter to the actual frame rate of your HDMI signal, the actual frame rate value is from the result of \u2018v4l2-ctl \u2013query-dv-timings\u2019 command. For the above HDMI device, because the frame rate is 60, so we modify the framerate parameter to 60 like the followint command. Record the video only: gst-launch-1.0 -vvv v4l2src ! \"video/x-raw,framerate=60/1,format=UYVY\" ! v4l2h264enc extra-controls=\"controls,h264_profile=4,h264_level=13,video_bitrate=256000;\" ! \"video/x-h264,profile=high, level=(string)4.2\" ! h264parse ! queue ! matroskamux name=mux ! filesink location=foo.mkv Record the video and audio: (if your shield supports audio also) gst-launch-1.0 -vvv v4l2src ! \"video/x-raw,framerate=60/1,format=UYVY\" ! v4l2h264enc extra-controls=\"controls,h264_profile=4,h264_level=13,video_bitrate=256000;\" ! \"video/x-h264,profile=high, level=(string)4.2\" ! h264parse ! queue ! matroskamux name=mux ! filesink location=foo.mkv alsasrc device=hw:1 ! audio/x-raw,rate=48000,channels=2 ! audioconvert ! avenc_aac bitrate=48000 ! aacparse ! queue ! mux. Note: alsasrc device=hw:1 \u2013 \u201c1\u201d means the audio card number, You must change to correct audio card number.

If you create a file edid.txt, then you can push this to the device using\" The comment of edid.txt file: 00ffffffffffff005262888800888888 1c150103800000780aEE91A3544C9926 0F505400000001010101010101010101 010101010101011d007251d01e206e28 5500c48e2100001e8c0ad08a20e02d10 103e9600138e2100001e000000fc0054 6f73686962612d4832430a20000000FD 003b3d0f2e0f1e0a2020202020200100 020321434e041303021211012021a23c 3d3e1f2309070766030c00300080E300 7F8c0ad08a20e02d10103e9600c48e21 0000188c0ad08a20e02d10103e960013 8e210000188c0aa01451f01600267c43 00138e21000098000000000000000000 00000000000000000000000000000000 00000000000000000000000000000000 cd ~ sudo nano edid.txt #copy the above commend in edid.txt, save&exit; pi@raspberrypi:~ $ v4l2-ctl --set-edid=file=edid.txt --fix-edid-checksums CTA-861 Header IT Formats Underscanned: yes Audio: yes YCbCr 4:4:4: no YCbCr 4:2:2: no HDMI Vendor-Specific Data Block Physical Address: 3.0.0.0 YCbCr 4:4:4 Deep Color: no 30-bit: no 36-bit: no 48-bit: no CTA-861 Video Capability Descriptor RGB Quantization Range: yes YCC Quantization Range: no PT: Supports both over- and underscan IT: Supports both over- and underscan CE: Supports both over- and underscan 7. The driver does NOT automatically switch to the resolution detected. Use the command: pi@raspberrypi:~ $ v4l2-ctl --query-dv-timings Active width: 1280 Active height: 720 Total width: 1650 Total height: 750 Frame format: progressive Polarities: -vsync -hsync Pixelclock: 74250000 Hz (60.00 frames per second) Horizontal frontporch: 0 Horizontal sync: 370 Horizontal backporch: 0 Vertical frontporch: 0 Vertical sync: 30 Vertical backporch: 0 Standards: Flags: You MUST set the timings via \u201cv4l2-ctl \u2013set-dv-bt-timings\u201d. You can pass in an index to the detected mode, or use: v4l2-ctl --set-dv-bt-timings query to select the currently detected timings. v4l2-ctl -V should now reflect the resolution detected. 8. The chip supports two formats \u2013 BGR3 (the default) and UYVY. BGR3 is 24bpp, and UYVY is YUV4:2:2 16bpp. Over the normal 2 CSI-2 lanes the data rate is such that BGR3 can run at a maximum of 1080p30, whilst UYVY will go up to 1080p50. Use the following command to select UYVY, however your application may override that. v4l2-ctl -v pixelformat=UYVY 9. Check that the audio drivers / card is available to ALSA. pi@raspberrypi:~ $ arecord -l **** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices **** card 1: tc358743 [tc358743], device 0: bcm2835-i2s-dir-hifi dir-hifi-0 [bcm2835-i2s-dir-hifi dir-hifi-0] Subdevices: 1/1 Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 Note: card 1 means that the card number for the TC358743XBG is \u201c1\u201d and it might be different. 10. Install GStreamer tool. sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-tools Check gstreamer tool version: pi@raspberrypi:~ $ gst-launch-1.0 --version gst-launch-1.0 version 1.18.4 GStreamer 1.18.4 http://packages.qa.debian.org/gstreamer1.0 Note: Different versions have different command line parameters, which is very annoying. 11. Use gstreamer to record video and audio #GStreamer v1.14 command gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src io-mode=5 ! video/x-raw, format=UYVY, framerate=25/1 ! v4l2h264enc output-io-mode=4 ! video/x-h264,profile=high ! h264parse ! queue ! matroskamux name=mux ! filesink location=foo.mkv alsasrc device=hw:1 ! audio/x-raw,rate=48000,channels=2 ! audioconvert ! avenc_aac bitrate=48000 ! aacparse ! queue ! mux. foo.mkv is the output file. If your gstreamer is version 1.8 or above, you can try the following test command. In addition, alsasrc device=hw:1 represents the sound card of TC358743, you can use \u201carecord -l\u201d to query. #The command to recode a video with audio. (GStreamer 1.18.4) gst-launch-1.0 -vvv v4l2src ! \"video/x-raw,framerate=30/1,format=UYVY\" ! v4l2h264enc extra-controls=\"controls,h264_profile=4,h264_level=13,video_bitrate=256000;\" ! \"video/x-h264,profile=high, level=(string)4.2\" ! h264parse ! queue ! matroskamux name=mux ! filesink location=foo.mkv alsasrc device=hw:1 ! audio/x-raw,rate=48000,channels=2 ! audioconvert ! avenc_aac bitrate=48000 ! aacparse ! queue ! mux. #The sample command to recode a video without audio. (C779 doesn't support audio) gst-launch-1.0 -vvv v4l2src ! \"video/x-raw,framerate=30/1,format=UYVY\" ! v4l2h264enc extra-controls=\"controls,h264_profile=4,h264_level=13,video_bitrate=256000;\" ! \"video/x-h264,profile=high, level=(string)4.2\" ! h264parse ! queue ! matroskamux name=mux ! filesink location=foo.mkv Press CTRL+C to end recording. PS: We recommend that you modify the above framerate parameter to the actual frame rate of your HDMI signal, the actual frame rate value is from the result of \u2018v4l2-ctl \u2013query-dv-timings\u2019 command. For the above HDMI device, because the frame rate is 60, so we modify the framerate parameter to 60 like the followint command. Record the video only: gst-launch-1.0 -vvv v4l2src ! \"video/x-raw,framerate=60/1,format=UYVY\" ! v4l2h264enc extra-controls=\"controls,h264_profile=4,h264_level=13,video_bitrate=256000;\" ! \"video/x-h264,profile=high, level=(string)4.2\" ! h264parse ! queue ! matroskamux name=mux ! filesink location=foo.mkv Record the video and audio: (if your shield supports audio also) gst-launch-1.0 -vvv v4l2src ! \"video/x-raw,framerate=60/1,format=UYVY\" ! v4l2h264enc extra-controls=\"controls,h264_profile=4,h264_level=13,video_bitrate=256000;\" ! \"video/x-h264,profile=high, level=(string)4.2\" ! h264parse ! queue ! matroskamux name=mux ! filesink location=foo.mkv alsasrc device=hw:1 ! audio/x-raw,rate=48000,channels=2 ! audioconvert ! avenc_aac bitrate=48000 ! aacparse ! queue ! mux. Note: alsasrc device=hw:1 \u2013 \u201c1\u201d means the audio card number, You must change to correct audio card number. (Query the car number via \u2018arecord \u2013l\u2019, refer to step 9)","title":"Software demo"},{"location":"hdmi-csi-i2s/#packing-list","text":"C790","title":"Packing List"},{"location":"hdmi-csi-i2s/#test-video","text":"C780A test:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecqyINoiHNQ C780B test:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc-hwPT2Uak&t=15s","title":"Test video"},{"location":"hdmi-csi-i2s/#purchase-link","text":"Purchase\uff1a C790 & C780 Purchase\uff1a C779","title":"Purchase link"},{"location":"usb-splitter-guide/","text":"USB/PWR Splitter guide 1.
