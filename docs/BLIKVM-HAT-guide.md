**4.** Connect the HDMI cable

!!! info "Connect the HDMI output port of the computer directly to the HDMI IN port of the HAT with an HDMI cable. The HDMI pass-through EDID emulator is not necessary! If your computer does not output the correct HDMI format, plug the HDMI pass-through EDID emulator into the HDMI output port of the computer. This allows you to configure a fixed HDMI output format on your computer."

## **Accessories**

### **ATX adapter board**

![Image title](image/BLIKVM-HAT/ATX-A-B.png){width="300"}

This board is connected to the switch port on the motherboard of the controlled computer with DuPont cables. 
The board has a standard PCIe I/O bracket and a low profile PCIe  I/O bracket.

### **USB/PWR splitter**
![Image title](image/BLIKVM-HAT/usb-spiltter.png){width="300"}

- Connect the RPI4 port to your Raspberry Pi 4.
- Connect the USB port to the controlled computer.
- When using PoE power supply, there is no need to connect the PWR port. When not using PoE power supply, connect the PWR port to a standard 5V/3A USB power supply.

### **HDMI pass-through EDID emulator**

![Image title](image/BLIKVM-HAT/edid-emulator.png){width="300"}

If the controlled computer does not output HDMI images correctly, please use this accessory. Connect the Source port to the controlled computer, connect the Sink port to the HAT. Then you can set the correct HDMI output on the controlled computer.

### **Metal case**

![Image title](image/BLIKVM-HAT/metal-case.png){width="300"}
